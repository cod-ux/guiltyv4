*(Navigate to the flutterflow branch instead of the main branch to view the code)*

A budgeting dashboard built for mobile with flutter for the front end and Python for the backend.

## Key Features

- Suggests and tracks the daily budget of the user based on budgeting goals
- Teases the user with positive & negative memes based on the user’s budget health
- Forecasts and predicts the runway of the user’s allocated budget for the month

## Result

Worked with startup mentors from the *[Who’s Fabio?*](https://www.whosfabio.com) community to identify a value proposition and launch for the student community.

> *“You’ve done a really good job identifying struggles that we’ve noticed the in the market as well and building a value proposition”*
